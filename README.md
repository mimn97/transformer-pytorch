# Attention is All You Need (Vaswani et al, 2017)


This is a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer model from scratch, suggested in the paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin, arxiv, 2017).

First, create a virtual environment and then run the following code to install required packages (pytorch, numpy, etc.): 
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

You can see the detailed implementations of Transformer in `model.py`. 

Codes were implemented with the following [blog reference written in Korean](https://code-angie.tistory.com/7).
